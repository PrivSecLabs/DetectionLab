# VMwARE CONFIGURATION

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The main objective was to set up a C2 server on an AttackBox, deliver payloads to a virtual machine, detect the activity using an EDR solution, and develop custom rules to block future execution attempts. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced knowledge of C2 server architecture, including configuration and payload delivery mechanisms.
- Proficiency in analyzing interpreting network logs and identifying IOCs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols such as open ports and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
